## What is GitHub?
**GitHub** is primarily a web application which allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.
It uses **Git** to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

### Git? Isn't Git just another name for GitHub?
**Git** is a **D**istributed **V**ersion **C**ontrol **S**ystem (**DVCS**) (which was based off of the concept of the [**S**ource **C**ode **C**ontrol **S**ystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System) (**SCCS**)) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicting with each other's changes. 

## A bit of history
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008
On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023). 
Headquartered in California, GitHub has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

It is a basic unit within the GitHub platform, serving as a centralized location to store all files, folders, and the complete revision history of a project.
