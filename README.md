# What_is_GitHub
Notes for high level overview of GitHub

## What is GitHub?
GitHub is primarily a web application which allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.
It uses Git to provide distributed version control and GitHub itself provides access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.
Headquartered in California, GitHub has been a subsidiary of Microsoft since 2018.

### Git? Isn't Git just another name for GitHub?
Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) (which was based off of the concept of the [Source Code Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System) (SCCS)) designed to track changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicting with each other's changes. 

## A bit of history
The development of the GitHub platform began on October 19, 2007. The site was launched in April 2008
On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion (~$8.96 billion in 2023). 
The deal closed on October 26, 2018

It is a basic unit within the GitHub platform, serving as a centralized location to store all files, folders, and the complete revision history of a project.
